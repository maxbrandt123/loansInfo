<h1>How Loans Work</h1>


<p>A loan is transfer of money from one party to another. Someone may ask for a loan when the need money, but don't have any.
Someone may loan a needy person money for the prospect of collecting interest. Interest is a predetermined percent of the loaned
money that is added on to the total the loanee owes the loaner.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Simple Interest Loans</h2>
<p>When taking out a loan, the amount borrowed is referred to as the principal. A SIL (Simple Interest Loan) is where
    the interest was calculated by multiplying the principal by the rate, multiplied by the number of time periods.<br>
    A simple equation to find the SIL is i = P x r x t <br>
    interest = Principal x rate x time
</p>

<br>

<h2>Compound Interest Loan</h2>
<p>A CIL (Compound Interest Loan) is a loan based off of the interest from the initial principle, as well as the the
    other interest charges of previous time periods. CIL can be properly explained as 'interest on the interest'.  It makes
    the total $ owed grow very quickly.  <br>
    Example: If I loan you $100 with a %10 monthly interest, after one month, you would owe me back $110 (10% of 100 is
    10, so the interest you would owe me is $10.  $10 plus the original $100 you took is a total of $110). However, after the
    second month, you know longer only owe me just an additional $10.  You would now owe me 10% of the <b>new</b> total
    ($110), which is an additional $11 ($11 dollars is the product of $10 of the latest total, $110).  The new total
    owed to me would be $121 ($110 + $11 = $121.)
</p>

<h2>Interest Only Loan</h2>
<p>
    An IOL (Interest Only Loan) is basically a mortgage with an adjustable rate that allows the loanee <b>just</b> the
    interest rate for the first few years or months (this time period is predetermined by the loaner and loanee.) That
    "teaser rate" introductory period typically lasts one, three, or five years.  The payment
    rises and lowers with the Libor rate (Libor stands for the London Interbank Offering Rate.)  Libor is the rate banks/loaners
    charge <b>eachother</b> for small loans. As Libor rises, so does the interest payment. As Libor lowers, so does
    the interest payment.
