<h1>How Loans Work</h1>


<p>A loan is transfer of money from one party to another. Someone may ask for a loan when the need money, but don't have any.
Someone may loan a needy person money for the prospect of collecting interest. Interest is a predetermined percent of the loaned
money that is added on to the total the loanee owes the loaner.</p>

<h2>Simple Interest Loans</h2>
<p>When taking out a loan, the amount borrowed is referred to as the principal. A SIL (Simple Interest Loan) is where
    the interest was calculated by multiplying the principal by the rate, multiplied by the number of time periods.<br>
    A simple equation to find the SIL is I = P x R x T <br>
    Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
